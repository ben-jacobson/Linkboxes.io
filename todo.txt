TODO list

- Probably a good idea to use a Captcha to ensure people can't just use a bot to create their own pages. We have space for 60M bookmark lists

- Re-Look at our list save method for the url_id hashing function, can we catch other exceptions and maybe do some logging? How can we test this a bit more for robustness 

- In your deployment script, alter Debug=False and disable the admin registrations

- We should come up with better terminology for List. It's not user friendly

- On Sign up, the verify password field has not yet been set up

- Test to see what injection someone can do with our input. E.g could they input some javascript into the page title? Django has autoescaping to resolve this



Proof of Concept requirements - For first initial deployment
-Has some sort of identifying brand which matches the domain name

    /-Edit button edits the link in real time
    /-Delete button deletes the link in real time
    /-Create button creates a new link, doesn't have to be real time
    -Copy button puts the url on the clipboard
    -User can drag and drop the items in the list to customise order, preference is stored in the database
    /-Simple text entry for link creation is fine
    -Creating a link without a thumbnail will user a placeholder
-Mobile friendly
-Functional and Unit testing in place (within reason)

Bugs

-After you edit a page, it seems to update all A hrefs on the page? Or at least when clicking on another edit icon it shows there. How come?
