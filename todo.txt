TODO list

- The owner of bookmarks.com wants $300K for the site. Maybe we call our service Bokmarks.com or some other misspelling of the service.

- Probably a good idea to use a Captcha to ensure people can't just use a bot to create their own pages. We have space for 60M bookmark lists

- Re-Look at our save method for the hashing function, can we catch other exceptions and maybe do some logging? How can we test this a bit more for robustness 

- In your deployment script, alter Debug=False and disable the admin registrations

- write some tests to demonstrate the many to one relationships, eg. testing reverse lookups

- We should come up with better terminology for List. It's not user friendly

- Remove our static reference in our bookmark grid view
